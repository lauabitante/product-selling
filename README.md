# Product Selling Simulator

This project was created to simulate a system where you can register products and customers, create orders by adding products to a cart, manage products stock as well as generate a bunch of different reports.

This project is using the [MVC pattern](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/MVC) in order to have a better separation of concerns
